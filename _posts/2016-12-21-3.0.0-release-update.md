So if you've come to this page lately you might have noticed some changes to
the layout and content. We're slowly marching towards releasing Genie 3.0.0. At
this point the only thing standing in the way is documentation.

The documentation has been slow in coming mostly cause we're trying to do it
right and not have to do another big bang documentation task in the future.
Each Genie release build now auto updates its documentation on the
[releases]({{ site.baseurl }}/releases/) page. This will help keep documentation
in sync for releases. Additionally since the REST API documentation is done
using [Spring Rest Docs](https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs/) combined
with our integration tests we should know if documentation gets out of sync
once tests start failing.

Today we've updated the [concepts]({{ site.baseurl }}/concepts/3/) page for
3.x. Hopefully soon we'll have the reference documentation done for how to
install and configure Genie. Once that is done we think we can **FINALLY** cut
the release for Genie 3.0.0. Looking forward to it!
